ETYMOLOGY 

(SUPPLIED BY A LATE CONSUMPTIVE USHER TO 
A GBAMMAB SCHOOL) 

THE pale Usher threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain ; 
I see him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and 
grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished 
with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. 
He loved to dust his old grammars ; it somehow mildly 
reminded him of his mortality. 



ETYMOLOGY 



' WHILE you take in hand to school others, and to teach 
them by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, 
leaving out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost 
alone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver 
that which is not true.' Hakluyt.

named from roundness or rolling ; for in Dan. hvalt is arched 
or vaulted.' Webster's Dictionary. 

' WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. 
and Ger. W alien ; A.S. Walw-ian y to roll, to wallow.'

EXTRACTS 
(SUPPLIED BY A SUB-SUB-LIBRARIAN) 

IT will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and 
grub -worm of a poor devil of a Sub -Sub appears to have gone 
through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, pick- 
ing up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways 
find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore 
you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy 
whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for 
veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the 
ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, 
these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording 
a glancing bird's-eye view of what has been promiscuously 
said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many 
nations and generations, including our own. 

So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commen- 
tator I am. Thou belo
